# Introduction to Basic Moderation Tools

Basic Moderation Tools is a fully open source admin module I built from the ground up, containing more than 30 commands to help you moderate your player base. It allows for creating custom commands, being able to interface with our simple API to simplify your scripts for different types of commands. Please note that BasicModTools has alot of bugs that I will try my best to remove. It will remain open-source for now until I crack down on all the bugs and release all the good features an admin module would need.

# Installing BMT2.4

To get started using Basic Moderation Tools 2.0, start by downloading the source code in the files section, named BasicModerationTools2.4. You will need to update a couple of settings before using the admin module.

# How to Setup BMT2.4

1. To get started, you will need to import the module by right clicking on the explorer and inserting BMT2.4 in.
2. Ungroup the folder '(Ungroup) Basic Moderation Tools 2.4 in ServerScriptService.
3. Drag all the folders into their respective locations, indicated by the folder name. Keep the module script in ServerScriptService (Important: Do not change the folder names if you don't know what your doing!)
4. Open up 'Basic Moderation Tools 2.0' (Module Script) and insure all the settings you want for your game are correct. This is important for command customization. (Note: You are automatically given the owner rank as the owner of the game, you do not need to add yourself into the admin table)
5. Join the game and BMT2.4 will load and start up.

# Custom Commands

To get started creating custom commands, open up the config script and go to the very bottom of the module script where it says 'CustomCommands'. You will see an example command that you'll be able to execute.
